  <p>The general approach to a subquadratic way of sorting involves what’s known as dividing and conquering, which is to say, breaking a collection of items into smaller collections of items and sorting those collections.<sup>*</sup> The breaking up of a collection into halves is logarithmic, as we saw earlier, and the putting of things back together again is linear, since we visit every item once. This approach to sorting is therefore said to be <i>linearithmic</i>, which you can think of as much faster than quadratic time and slightly slower than linear time.<sup>&dagger;</sup> Alternatively, it might be referred to as <i>log-linear</i> or simply <i>n log n</i>—the order we get from the time it takes to split the collection (<i>log n</i>) and to then put it back together again (<i>n</i>), which when multiplied produce <i>n log n</i>. “Linearithmic” comes from combining the words “linear” and “logarithmic,” resulting in a concept that suggests a degree of sophistication absent in the original parts. Much like Jedward.</p>
  <p>Two well-known linearithmic algorithms are <i>mergesort</i>, invented by John von Neumann in 1945, and <i>quicksort</i>, invented by Tony Hoare in 1959. Charlie’s Method 2 was akin to how mergesort works. The breaking-up step there</p>

    <sup>*</sup> The process implicitly involves a concept—called recursion—that we’ll not really go into in this book but that you should certainly read about.<br />
    <sup>&dagger;</sup> Recall that logarithms grow slowly.
