  <p>In real life, whenever we’re sorting a number of things by hand, as Charlie is in this scenario, some variation of Method 1 is what we would likely use. As we have seen in the comparison graphs so far, this appears to be a general rule—for a few items, any method of undertaking the task at hand is probably fine. It is only when the number of items goes up that one method might become noticeably better than the other. Though Method 2 might not have a practical corollary in real life—in sorting at least—we’ll discuss its general approach in conceptual terms.<sup>*</sup></p>
  <p>Notice first that Method 1 has a certain cadence to it. Charlie takes one bunch of envelopes, then looks through all the other bunches to determine where to put it. He then takes another bunch of envelopes and looks through all the other bunches, and so on. We have seen that type of approach before, haven’t we? With the pile of socks. A notable difference is that for each envelope, Charlie looks at all the other envelopes just once, whereas with the pile of socks, Morwenna could potentially spend a long time searching for a match in the pile.</p>
