  <h1>3. Pop to the shops</h1>
  <p class='capital' style='margin-top: 100px'>Iain is a retired linguistics teacher who lives in East London. He has a bad back from a fall a few years ago. He hates leaving the house because the neighbor’s dog scares him, but alas, if he doesn’t want to die of hunger, he has to pop to the shops every so often to buy his own groceries. This being London, it rains a lot, and Iain being Iain, doesn’t like getting wet. How might Iain minimize the number of times he goes to the store within a given week without dying of hunger?</p>
