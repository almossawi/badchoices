  <p class='no-indent'>There is a timeless sketch that the British double act The Two Ronnies did during their many years on air.<sup>*</sup> In it, a customer walks into a hardware store and reads off the items on his list, one by one. Rather than waiting for his customer to read the entire list first, the store owner instead retrieves an item each time the customer reads it out, which ends up causing the store owner great distress.</p>
  <p>Keep this vignette in mind. We’ll come back to it in a bit. But first, let’s see how Iain might go about deciding how often to go to the store.</p>

  <p class='no-indent comparison-box'>
    <span class='concept-title'>Objective:</span> Make as few trips to the grocery store in a given week as possible.<br />
    <span class='concept-title'>Method 1:</span> Realize he has run out of something. Head to the store to buy it.<br />
    <span class='concept-title'>Method 2:</span> Maintain a list of things that he has run out of. Go to the store once the list reaches a certain size or once he runs out of an essential life-affirming food item, like Kit Kat bars.<sup>&dagger;</sup>
