In the case of car parts, a dot might indicate a physical dependency, as in a wheel depends on an axle and an axle depends on the chassis. There, a practical application of link analysis would be to help answer a question like, “A lot of complaints have been coming in. We think it’s due to a high level of complexity in this car model. Can you give me a list of the most highly connected parts?” The wheel is connected to two other parts, either directly or indirectly. Are there parts that are connected to four other parts, or five or ten? A greater number of connections in the case of artists is a good thing as it indicates influence. In the case of car parts, it could be a bad thing as it can signal a potential propensity for failures.</p>
  <p>That can be useful as a starting point. At the cost of jumping between genres, we might choose to move from the most influential artist to the second most influential artist and so on. If at some point we’re more interested in jumping from a song to another song that is similar to the one we are listening to, we will have to adopt a different approach.</p>
