  <p class='no-indent'>Order helps us do things faster. Imagine if a newspaper didn’t list local events by day or if the episodes for a TV show that you were planning to binge-watch weren’t listed in sequence. How annoying would it be to spend time rummaging for the next episode when that time could be better spent witnessing an ill-fated meth dealer get dealt yet another blow by a cruel universe.</p>
  <p>Let us describe how Charlie might go about addressing his immediate dilemma.</p>

  <p class='no-indent comparison-box'>
    <span class='concept-title'>Objective:</span> Put the scattered bunches of envelopes back in the right order.<br />
    <span class='concept-title'>Method 1:</span> Put one bunch of envelopes on the ground in front of him. Take a second bunch and if the address is closer, place it to the left of that first bunch. and So on, until the closest addresses are toward the left of the line and the farthest ones are toward the right.<br />
    <span class='concept-title'>Method 2:</span> Line up the bunches of envelopes on the ground in front of him. Split the line so that half are to either side. Split each of those halves, and so on. For each pair of bunches, put the closer address on the left and the farther one on the right, then do that for each pair of pairs and so on.
