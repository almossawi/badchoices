    <p>Before reading any further, I would suggest working through these scenes using pen and paper, props, or whatever else you feel comfortable with. Think about what achieving the objective entails in terms of individual steps and assumptions. Try to do that for all the scenes that follow.</p>
    <p>With a pile of, say, four pairs of socks, it doesn’t really matter which method Morwenna uses—she will be done fairly quickly. Now imagine Morwenna with hundreds of socks in front of her. If she opts for the first method, the chance that she will come across the same old sock over and over again is quite high, since she never takes it out of the pile. When she first comes across it, she simply doesn’t glean any information from it. With the second method, however, she keeps a line of unmatched socks to one side, thus ensuring that she only ever comes across a sock in the pile once. The second method, therefore, ends up being faster because of its reliance on memory. More precisely, because of what’s sometimes called a <i>lookup table</i> or <i>cache</i>. Though it need not be, it is useful to think of a lookup table as a collection of unique identifiers (keys) each pointing to some associated item of data (values) where you, quite literally, look up the values of keys. We call this type of representation a <i>key-value pair</i>. In this case, our keys would likely be “color.”</p>
