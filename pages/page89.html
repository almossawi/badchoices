  <h1>7. Update that status</h1>
  <p class='capital' style='margin-top: 40px'>Dwayne is on a walking tour of the Canadian Rockies. Crystal clear turquoise lakes lie motionless as their surfaces reflect with pinpoint accuracy the extraordinary grandeur of the mountains and trees above. Birds chirp and swoop beneath a clear sky while a gentle breeze makes its way toward the east. In that moment, the world seems like the most tranquil of places. No rivers of blood. No climate change. No poverty. No Kanye West. “The idealists were right,” a fleeting cloud whispers from beyond the horizon. “They were right.” And yet, Dwayne’s mind is elsewhere. You see, a peculiar sight caught his eye that morning, just as his group was heading out of Vancouver. He witnessed a mallard wiggling around as though it were dancing the rhumba, and he has been struggling ever since. Struggling to find a witty yet succinct sentence to capture the hilarity of that scene that adheres to the 140-character limit imposed on him by the very tool meant to set him free. He cannot risk letting down the crowd of strangers whose approval he so relies on.</p>
