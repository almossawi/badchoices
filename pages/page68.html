  <p>In computing, many of the simplest ways in which items are sorted run in quadratic time because, like Charlie’s Method 1, they all happen to work by comparing adjacent items and potentially switching them around depending on which is bigger and which is smaller. We can in fact say with confidence that all approaches to sorting that follow this pattern of comparing adjacent items, run in quadratic time (<i>n<sup>2</sup></i>) on average. Put differently, if <i>n</i> is the number of envelopes, we might describe the function that puts those envelopes back in the right order by way of comparing adjacent envelopes as “bounded below by <i>n<sup>2</sup></i>,” which is to say, on average (key word), we simply can’t be faster than that. Some examples include <i>insertion sort</i>, <i>selection sort</i>, and <i>bubble sort</i>.</p>
  <p>When I first learned about sorting as a sixteen-year-old schoolboy, I remember not quite understanding at first how one could do any better than quadratic time. The graph on page 55 suggests that Method 2 is noticeably faster than Method 1, so there does appear to be a way to sort in subquadratic time.</p>
