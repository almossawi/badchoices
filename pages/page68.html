  <p>Notice first that Method 1 has a certain cadence to it. Charlie takes one bunch of envelopes, then looks through all the other bunches to determine where to put it. He then takes another bunch of envelopes and looks through all the other bunches, and so on. We have seen that type of approach before, haven’t we? With the pile of socks. A notable difference is that for each envelope, Charlie looks at all the other envelopes just once, whereas with the pile of socks, Morwenna could potentially spend a long time searching for a match in the pile.</p>
  <p>In computing, many of the simplest ways in which items are sorted run in quadratic time because, like Charlie’s Method 1, they all happen to work by comparing adjacent items and potentially switching them around depending on which is bigger and which is smaller. We can in fact say with confidence that all approaches to sorting that follow this pattern of comparing adjacent items, run in quadratic time (<i>n<sup>2</sup></i>) on average. Put differently, if <i>n</i> is the number of envelopes, we might describe the function that puts those envelopes back in the right order by way of comparing adjacent envelopes as “bounded below by <i>n<sup>2</sup></i>,” which is to say, on average (key word), we simply can’t be faster than that. Some examples include</p>
