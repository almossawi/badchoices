  <p>Two well-known linearithmic algorithms are <i>mergesort</i>, invented by John von Neumann in 1945, and <i>quicksort</i>, invented by Tony Hoare in 1959. Charlie’s Method 2 was akin to how mergesort works. The breaking-up step there involves separating the set of bunches of envelopes into individual bunches. And the putting-back-together step involves comparing and combining sets of bunches. After doing the latter step the first time, we would end up with sets of two in-order bunches. After doing it a second time, we would end up with sets of four in-order bunches, and so on. In Charlie’s case, the process would look like the following diagram.</p>
  <p>Notice how he goes from a set of unsorted envelopes in the first step to a set of sorted groups of envelopes, albeit of one size, in the second step. In each subsequent step, he further merges the envelopes creating larger sets of sorted envelopes until he is left with a single set containing all the envelopes. If we zoom into one of those steps, say step 4, we can see how the merging actually takes place.</p>

    <sup>*</sup> The process implicitly involves a concept—called recursion—that we’ll not really go into in this book but that you should certainly read about.<br />
