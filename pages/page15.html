    <h2>Why focus on relative magnitudes?</h2>
    <p class='no-indent'>Comparisons are amazingly powerful. One of the first things children learn are abstractions like <i>big</i> and <i>small</i>, which is why when a child asks, “How tall is that titanosaur that they now have at the Natural History Museum?” one finds that it is less meaningful for the child to hear the response, “Seventeen feet tall, little one,” and more meaningful to hear, “If Ms. Susan, Ms. Margaret, and Mr. Jascha were to stand on each other’s shoulders, Mr. Jascha would probably be able to tickle the titanosaur’s chin.”</p>
    <p>Thinking in terms of relative magnitudes may in fact be an ability that we are all born with. Recent experiments seem to suggest that babies show as much brain activity in response to a change in an image they are seeing as they do in response to noticeable changes in the <i>number</i> of images they are seeing. Other experiments in</p>

In my experience, any learning environment that encourages students to be fast learners is setting its students up for failure.</p>
