  <p>Huffman was a maverick, though. He looked at those seven bits and said, “Surely, there must be a way to compress things.” His friends pleaded with him. “No, Huffman,” they said. “It can’t be done, Huffman. It’s too much to ask of one man, Huffman. Don’t be a hero, Huffman.” But Huffman didn’t care. He was willing to propel himself into the unknown if it meant that he could potentially come up with an optimal binary representation for a set of characters.</p>

  <p>Rather than using fixed-length binary codes, Huffman opted for variable-length ones. He exploited the fact that some characters in a sentence appear more often than other characters, and so he mapped the more frequently occurring letters to smaller values, and hence shorter binary codes, and less frequently occurring ones to longer binary codes. For example, say that we have determined that for a given body of data, the frequency distribution of characters is as shown on the left.</p>
  <p>In other words, the letter “e” occurs 705 times, the letter “a” occurs 605 times, and so on. Notice that the characters are sorted from top to bottom in order of most to least frequent. Huffman’s</p>
