  <h1>1. Match those socks</h1>
  <p class='capital' style='margin-top: 100px'>Baroness Morwenna is a member of a formerly influential Viennese family who was recently indicted for smuggling Kinder Surprise eggs into the United States. She now works as an au pair in Bern and is folding clothes for the first time. Morwenna is shocked to discover that each member of her host family sweats through a pair of socks every half hour, making finding and matching pairs more time-consuming than she ever imagined. On the plus side, they have different shoe sizes and like different colors.</p>
  <p><i>Hint: While there might be several tasks here, perhaps start with the fundamental&nbsp;one.</i></p>
