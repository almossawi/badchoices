  <p class='no-indent'>French mathematician Edouard Lucas’s <i>Récréations Mathématiques</i>, published in 1882. Recent research also seems to suggest that other creatures, namely ants, may use a form of backtracking to recover from a broken trail. The approach is faster than Method 1 and is able to handle loops, unlike Method 2.</p>
  <p>Note that the three methods we’ve covered here are useful for when we are already inside a maze and want to get out. There are other methods to escape a maze that might be much faster but require that we know beforehand what the maze looks like. The methods we’ve seen here don’t guarantee a shortest path out of the maze. Those other ones might.</p>
  <p>Now, you don’t have to be lost in Rome’s catacombs or a hapless character in a Stephen King novel for these maze-solving approaches to come in handy. There are dozens of real-life mazes all across the world, some spanning several miles, where the lessons we’ve seen here can prove useful. More generally, this idea of getting from one point to another in a constrained environment, like that of a maze, is important—the network, or graph, which is an alternative way of describing a maze where passages are edges and intersections are vertices, is at the heart of many of the applications that we use and rely on nowadays. An application that knows how</p>
