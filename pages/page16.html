    <p class='no-indent'>remoter parts of the world suggest that people who have not been subjected to what we might call formal education reason about numbers in terms of orders of magnitude. It’s an intuition that we appear to have innately.</p>
    <p>One subspecies of humans whose appreciation for this intuition is manifest is computer scientists. It’s what gives them the ability to recognize, fairly quickly, which of several competing approaches to solving a problem might be better. That fact is a reminder that seeing things in terms of relative magnitudes is an ability that remains useful even after you develop mastery of a field. Think of it like the mathematical notation you learned in primary school, which you continued to use throughout school and college and beyond.</p>
    <p>This idea is a large part of the motivation behind writing this book. I had long used comparisons, estimates, and approximations to understand various concepts during my school and college years, but I dared not admit that to anyone because it felt like a less sophisticated way of learning. It wasn’t until I read books like <i>The Strangest Man</i>* and The Society of Mind that I realized I wasn’t the only one who found that way of thinking useful. Much later, I read <i>The Art of Insight in Science and Engineering</i> and similar books, which talk of the same idea and its implications</p>
