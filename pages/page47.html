  <p>It’s humbling reading about how concepts that we consider intuitive nowadays came to be. It makes us realize that those concepts only became obvious after someone went through the trouble of spelling them out. For an interesting take on that, you might want to read about the Flynn effect, named after Jim Flynn, which suggests that humanity has been getting smarter in part because our intuitions continue to mature and become more sophisticated. New humans now come preinstalled with intuitions that are better than those of their forefathers. Reading old texts and treatises is always fun, as they show us how far we have come. I recall once picking up Desiderius Erasmus’s <i>Handbook on Good Manners for Children</i>, published in 1530, in which readers are given advice such as “Don’t let your nostrils be full of snot like some grubby person; Socrates was criticized for that vice.” To a reader in the twenty-first century, the advice seems self-evident. And yet within the context of that period, it was novel.</p>
  <p>Turing’s talk of subsidiary operations brings to mind yet another real-life example where a stack would be useful. Imagine if the mailman were to stop by the next morning at Iain’s house and refuse to look him in the eyes. A solitary tear runs down the mailman’s cheek. His lips might perhaps quiver.</p>
