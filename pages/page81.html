  <p class='no-indent'>determining which artists might be similar to, say, Bob Marley is to consider listeners—how many people who listen to Eric Clapton also listen to Marley? How many people who listen to Stevie Wonder also listen to Marley? And so on. If we do that for all artists and rank the resulting values from highest to lowest, we get a sense of which other artists might be most similar to Bob Marley. The process is a bit more nuanced and can be improved upon using a number of more advanced methods. For instance, using what’s known as a Jaccard index rather than simply counting, common listeners can help avoid results that might be skewed by artists who have many listeners.</p>
  <p>You see the outcome of this form of analysis anytime you bring up the results page of a search engine or are presented with your news feed on a social media Web site, or are given recommendations about “items you might want to buy” on a shopping Web site or suggestions for “people you may want to connect to” on a professional networking Web site. Newspapers do it too, by modeling an article in terms of, say, the topics that it addresses, and then consider how similar that article is to other ones. And video-streaming services’s entire competitive advantage might rely on predicting what a subscriber likes and recommending content that is similar</p>
