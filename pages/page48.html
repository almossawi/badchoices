  <p>“As a matter of fact you did. As a matter of fact. You did,” the mailman replies, swinging his gaze to the horizon. The way in which Iain would try to recall how he might have offended the mailman would likely be akin to popping items out of a stack. Namely, his “mailman” stack. The metaphor is apt because his most recent interaction with the mailman is more likely to be the culprit than the previous one, and the previous one is more likely to be the culprit than the one before that.</p>
  <p>Are there other things in everyday life that work like stacks? How about the Web? Every time you click on a link, you’re pushing a Web site onto a stack, and every time you go back to a previous link, you’re popping a Web site from that stack. You might not care how many Web sites you’ve visited in total, so long as you can go back to the last one, and from that one to the one before it, and so&nbsp;on.</p>
