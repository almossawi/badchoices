  <h1>2. Find your size</h1>
  <p class='capital' style='margin-top: 100px'>It’s the day after Christmas, and Eppy Toam, a nurse from Inverness, has started camping outside of a department store in preparation for this year’s Boxing Day sale. Her shirt size is quite common and she wants to make sure she is the first one into the store so that she can grab all the shirts that are in her size. She is going to have to be fast. Things get pretty ugly. Last year, fifteen people were injured and the army had to intervene. How might Eppy increase her odds of grabbing the shirts she’s after before everybody else?</p>
  <p><i>Hint: Consider pushing the example to an absurd limit. What if the racks were as wide as the store?</i></p>
