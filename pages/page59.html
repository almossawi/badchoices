  <p class='no-indent'>roads are connected—OpenStreetMap, for example—can tell you how best to drive from your apartment to the beach; a Web site that knows how people, places, and things are connected—say, Google’s Knowledge Graph—can produce better search results; a Web site that knows who your friends are—Facebook or LinkedIn, for example—can better guess who else you’re likely to know; and a software system that knows how its components and modules are connected—say, Firefox—can better predict where future defects are likely to arise based on the pattern and density of connections.</p>
  <p>Even robot vacuums serve as a good example. Not all robot vacuums are created equal, it turns out, because some are not as sophisticated as others when it comes to how much of a room they are able to cover. The simpler ones might roam around in random lines or in circles, whereas the better ones might map a room first, determining where the walls and any nooks and corners might be, and then move back and forth from one end to the other in a grid-like pattern. In other words, when a robot knows how best to get from one part of the room to the other, it maximizes its objective, resulting in a cleaner room.</p>
