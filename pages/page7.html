    <p class='no-indent definition'>A finite, unambiguous set of rules that give a sequence of operations for solving a specific type of problem. An algorithm has zero or more inputs and one or more outputs, and its steps are basic enough that a human being equipped with a pen and paper may, in principle, be able to perform them in a reasonable amount of time.<sup>*</sup></p>

	<p class='footnote' style='width:350px;text-align:justify'><sup>*</sup> This definition is a paraphrase of the more elaborate definition given in Donald Knuth's seminal work, <i>The Art of Computer Programming</i>. Herein, an algorithm refers specifically to a computing algorithm.</p>-->
