<h1>Preface</h1>
<p class='capital'>Did you know that Richard Feynman started developing the equations that won him the Nobel Prize after seeing someone throw a plate in the air? Or that John von Neumann modeled parts of his electronic computer on a friend’s idea about how memories are stored in the human brain? Or that the sight of a kicking and screaming orangutan at the zoo led Charles Darwin to his big idea? What Feynman, von Neumann, Darwin, and others have in common is that they see physics and mathematics and science everywhere, way beyond the confines of their&nbsp;laboratories.</p>
<p>Even if you’re not gunning for a Nobel Prize, you probably do things in your everyday life that can be modeled as algorithms. In fact, you apply them on a daily basis to solve various problems: finding pairs of socks in a pile of clothes, deciding when to go to the grocery store, determining how to prioritize your tasks for the day, and so on. An algorithm is a series of unambiguous steps that achieves some meaningful objective in finite time. The series might begin with some input and</p>
