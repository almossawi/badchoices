  <h1>5. Sort that post</h1>
  <p class='capital' style='margin-top: 100px'>Charlie is already behind on his postal rounds. It is the middle of July in Miami, and it's super hot. To make matters worse, being the absentminded mail carrier that he is, he just knocked over his box of internally sorted mail, mixing all the bunches of letters that were meant for the thirty-three individual addresses on his rounds. To make matters even worse, he has photosensitive skin and he forgot his sunblock at home. He is on his knees, on the scorching gravel, picking up the mail and trying to put everything in order again as quickly as he can before his skin&nbsp;suffers.</p>
