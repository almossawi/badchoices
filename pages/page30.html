    <p>All of that is just an aside, though. Our main takeaway from this scene is that an approach that reuses knowledge can be faster than one that doesn’t. This is particularly useful to know when our task involves doing something over and over again—you’re in a store, looking through a box of letter-shaped candles for your daughter’s birthday cake. Or you’re about to wash your clothes and need to separate your whites from your colors and from your delicates. Or you’re trying to win a game by coming up with the longest word from a set of jumbled-up letters, as they do on the British TV show <i>Countdown</i>, where contestants have thirty seconds to come up with the longest word they can make from the nine letters in front of them.</p>
    <p>In each of those situations, ask yourself if the task at hand could be made faster by leveraging memory—yours or the world’s. With our pile of socks, we exploited the fact that we had no more than five variations of socks by maintaining a line of unmatched socks. With our box of candles, we would pick out any of the four letters we need the moment we come across it, rather than searching for “L” and then for “U” and so on.</p>
