    <p class='no-indent'>Have you ever thought about how essential a biological feature <i>memory</i> is in humans? The image of someone leaning back into her chair, putting one hand to her forehead, and pressing her eyes shut as she calls to mind a verse or an equation or a telephone number—that’s the quintessential human. Imagine the struggle of having to go through life without that feature, as do sufferers of dementia. For starters, you would end up having to repeat a lot of the same work. Like in <i>Memento</i>, where every morning the protagonist has to fill up his mind all over again with all the bits of information that he needs to carry out his primary task.</p>
    <p>I mention this at the outset because of the fact that faster methods of solving problems are often faster because they happen to leverage memory.<sup>*</sup> Consider AlphaGo, which last year beat a champion at the game of Go thanks to its ability to learn not only from expert humans but also from itself, thus amassing a greater memory from which to work.<sup>&dagger;</sup> Put differently, many of the faster ways of solving problems that we will encounter in this book, simple though they are, are fast because of their ability to avoid doing the same action on the same thing</p>

    <p class='footnote'><sup>*</sup> A fact that is sometimes characterized with the phrase, “trading memory for time.”<br />
    <sup>&dagger;</sup> This approach was pioneered at the University of Toronto a decade ago and is referred to as deep learning.</p>
