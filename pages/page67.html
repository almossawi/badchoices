  <p>Charlie’s approach in Method 1 is a signature <i>quadratic-time</i> algorithm.<sup>*</sup> Anytime you have a collection of things that you’re searching through, be they of the same type or of different types, and you find yourself scanning that entire collection for each one of those things, you have a <i>quadratic-time</i> algorithm. Other examples of quadratic-time algorithms would be going through a pile of shirts and seeing which of the trousers in your wardrobe goes with which shirt, or looking through your grocery list and scanning the items on a store shelf to see if they have the item</p>

  <p class='footnote'><sup>*</sup> Quadratic, since the time it takes one to sort the envelopes increases by an order of <i>n<sup>2</sup></i> with the number of envelopes. In other words, an order of 100, say, seconds for 10 envelopes, 10,000 seconds for 100 envelopes, and so on.</p>
