    <p>With the dirty clothes, we might keep them in three separate baskets to begin with rather than rummage through the clothes prior to a wash. And with the longest word situation, we might look for any word that we can form at first sight and then see if weâ€™re able to lengthen it by, say, conjugating it or making it plural. In such a case, our initial choice serves as a sort of prefix (hence, memory) to subsequent words. There is a fascinating tree-based structure called a <i>trie</i> that does exactly that. It exploits the fact that words or numbers share prefixes and uses that knowledge to make things like spell-checking and auto-completing words that you might enter into a search box much faster.</p>
