  <h1>4. Bring him home</h1>
  <p class='capital' style='margin-top: 100px'>Ioannis is lost in his own tailor shop. Iconic though his shop is among Athenians for its impossibly speedy turnarounds, Ioannis is known as a hoarder. A disposition made worse by the fact that his shop sits on a massive plot of land, most of which is unused. The shop has been expanding onto that land over the past three decades as Ioannis builds more passages and puts up more shelves to fuel his habit. And now here he is, somewhere in that messy maze, with walls covered in an endless array of thread rolls and clothes and broken sewing machines. How on earth is Ioannis going to find his way back to the front? Or is he destined to perish here in this labyrinth of his own creation?</p>
