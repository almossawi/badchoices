  <h1>6. Be more hip</h1>
  <p class='capital' style='margin-top: 60px'>Foy is a recent transplant to the fine city of Ashland. Despite his carefully maintained goatee, and insistence on always appearing in public with a months-old copy of the New Yorker tucked under one arm—a copy he has never read, mind you, but which he likes to nonchalantly pick up and toss down in front of him whenever he’s at a café or restaurant—Foy remains an outsider in his new home. His go-to response to any open-ended question, “Milton wouldn’t be too happy, I can tell you that,” is wearing thin. What do you think of Karl Ove Knausgaard’s latest book, Foy? Milton wouldn’t be too happy, I can tell you that. Did you enjoy Adele’s new single, Foy? Milton wouldn’t be too happy, I can tell you that. Alarmed by his crumbling facade, Foy has finally decided to overcome his faults and truly become one with culture and the arts. As a start, he would like to identify the world’s most influential music and bathe in its glory but, overwhelmed by the choice in Ashland’s record shops, he doesn’t know what to do.</p>
