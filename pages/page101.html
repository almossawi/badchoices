  <h1>Final remarks</h1>
  <p class='capital' style='margin-top: 40px'>When Feynman was once asked how he developed his legendary ability to solve problems so quickly, he said that it was because he modeled those problems in a multitude of ways, which is to say he looked at them from different perspectives. Analogies are one way of looking at a problem, equations are another, the dialectical method is yet another. For Feynman, ever the showman, a fantastically fictional story that was sure to astonish his audience was yet another. There is an analog to that approach in art, where the ability to paint a scene from different perspectives without any loss of detail is considered a virtue. Interestingly, it was an innovation from Brunelleschi during the Renaissance that made that possible. By devising a mathematical way of codifying linear perspective, Brunelleschi was able to render a perfectly accurate drawing of the Baptistery of Saint John in Florence. Objects that were closer looked bigger, those far away looked smaller, and the lines of the baptisteryâ€™s tiles converged in a way that was in accordance with reality.
