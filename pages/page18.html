    <p>It is relatable: Many of the explanations in this book leverage illustrations. Explaining by way of illustrations is not only useful because of the appeal that illustrations bring to an otherwise pedestrian work, but also because illustrations can place one in a world that is relatable, and relatable worlds are engaging and encourage you to be more sophisticated in your reasoning as you connect newly acquired knowledge with what you already know.

In such a model, you’re seen as a sort of container and your instructor’s task is to pour in the knowledge. To borrow yet another metaphor, it’s like watching a sitcom with a laugh track, in which somebody else is doing the laughing on your behalf. In this book each lesson is presented through an everyday scenario, encouraging you to develop your own understanding by interacting with the scenes, talking through them, and thinking beyond them to your own life and daily routines.
