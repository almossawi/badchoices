  <p>We only needed 11 bits for that rather than 28 bits. This insight brings to mind an innovation from nearly a century earlier—that of how best to transmit messages between electric telegraphs. There, Samuel Morse’s way of deciding which letters were represented using which codes was also based on how frequently letters occurred in the English language. Interestingly though, Morse determined the frequency of various letters not by talking to experts or conducting a study or analyzing data, but by counting the number of types in a printer’s type box.
