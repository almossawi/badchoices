    <p>Let’s not get ahead of ourselves though. Back to the socks, and to poor old Morwenna, the irony of whose name was lost on the federal agents who recently seized her stash of chocolate goodness. Morwenna is facing the daunting task of matching pairs of socks from a humongous pile of clothes. Let us focus on one of several tasks that exist here and consider two possible methods for taking on that&nbsp;task:</p>
    <p class='no-indent comparison-box'>
      <span class='concept-title'>Objective:</span> Match the pairs of socks in this pile of clothes.<br />
      <span class='concept-title'>Method 1:</span> Pick a sock, look for its match in the pile, put it to one side. Then pick another sock, look for its match in the pile, and put it to one side. And so on.<br />
      <span class='concept-title'>Method 2:</span> Pick a sock, put it to one side. Pick another sock. If it matches any of the ones she has put to one side, match it. Otherwise, add it to the line of unmatched socks, lumping it with socks that have the same color or size.<sup>*</sup>
    </p>

    <p class='footnote'><sup>*</sup> Note that with both methods, we ignore the task of separating socks from non-socks because we’re focused on the fundamental task of matching socks.</p>
