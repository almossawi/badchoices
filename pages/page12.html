    <p class='no-indent'>is expected to produce an output. Those are an algorithm’s characteristics. What’s fascinating is that Babylonian tablets from around 1800 to 1600 BCE reveal that ancient Babylonians wrote down their procedures for determining things like, say, compound interest or the width and length of a cistern given its height and volume using algorithms. That is to say, their procedures were made up of an unambiguous series of steps; they had some input, some output, they eventually terminated and they were useful. Algorithms can thus be found in the works of various contributors to mathematics over the centuries. After the advent of computers, these characteristics have proved crucial because they allow computers to carry out tasks in a way that is predictable.</p>
    <p>Despite the importance of algorithms in our lives, texts on the subject tend to focus largely on intricate details—the “how”—while perhaps ignoring the more practical lessons of those algorithms that make them appealing. The seemingly simple everyday tasks we just mentioned can be undertaken in a number of different ways. The more aware we are of those ways, the better we can hone our ability to achieve a task in the most efficient way. Think of it like enhancing a general-purpose intuition that we all possess. That’s where <i>Bad Choices</i> comes in. This book aims to</p>
