  <p>Data compression techniques like Huffman coding are immensely important in the real world. Making optimal use of space means that Web sites load faster—Web servers can compress files before sending them across the network, and modern Web browsers can decompress them. When bandwidth is scarce, any such speed gain is critical. Compression also means that movies (think MPEG-2), pictures (think JPEG), and songs (think MP3) can all take up less space than they otherwise would have, saving money on their storage and transfer. Audio formats like MP3 are quite interesting in that their compression model relies on targeting audio components that humans can’t hear due to biological or neurological limitations. For instance, the human ear isn’t able to hear sound frequencies above 20,000 Hz.</p>
  <p>The next time you have a voice or video conversation with someone without any drop in quality, think of the contribution that compression has made to that activity. Technology has matured to the point that your application only needs to send some data over the network and can then either infer or reconstruct the rest on the other end. In effect, compression helps lower the barrier to use of a technology.</p>
  <p>That’s all well and good. But what about Dwayne? Dwayne. Dwayne and his</p>
