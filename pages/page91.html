This balance reflects the typical balance we see in practice when it comes to evaluating different approaches to solving problems—often, computer scientists compare the relative <i>speeds</i> of competing approaches, also known as their <i>run-time complexity</i>, but occasionally, they will compare them based on how much memory or disk space they require, also known as their <i>space complexity</i>.</p>

  <p>What’s fascinating is that Method 2 has an analog in computing. In 1952, computer scientist David A. Huffman came up with a method that reduced the amount of space required to store data. Unlike the earlier examples, Huffman’s approach didn’t involve removing things but rather focused on optimizing things as we will see in a bit. The way computers store data such as words is by mapping the</p>
