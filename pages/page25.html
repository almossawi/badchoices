    <p class='no-indent'>When Morwenna comes across, say, a red sock, she looks up “red” in her line of unmatched socks. If she finds a “red” area, she might then look for additional identifiers like, say, style or hue and take things from there. Otherwise, she would create a new “red” area with the solitary red sock.</p>
    <p>The following page shows how the two methods compare.<sup>*</sup> Notice that Method 1 becomes noticeably slower than Method 2 as the number of socks in the pile grows. There are many more ways of tackling the tasks in this book than the two methods that are highlighted. The discussion is meant to emphasize two methods that are notably different in their asymptotic rates of growth, leaving out other methods whose performance may fall somewhere in between. With this scene, for instance, Morwenna might have chosen, alternatively, to find matches by way of the pigeonhole principle, which would have involved pulling six socks from the pile at a time and matching pairs that way.</p>

    <p class='footnote'><sup>*</sup> There are more nuanced ways of looking at these rates of growth. One is in terms of whether a particular method grows no faster than the rate shown (known as <i>big-o notation</i>) or no slower than the rate shown (known as <i>big-Ω notation</i>, and read <i>big-omega</i>). Another is to consider whether the rates of growth describe the best, worst, or average cases. We will be talking about these different cases later on.</p>
