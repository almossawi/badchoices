    <p class='no-indent'>acquaint you with algorithmic thinking by highlighting different ways of approaching everyday tasks and pointing out how these approaches fare <i>relative</i> to each other. For instance, two methods of looking for a shirt in your size on a rack of shirts might be described like the graph on the following page.<sup>*</sup></p>
    <p>Those shapes of lines have names like <i>linear</i> and <i>logarithmic</i>, which we will flesh out and discuss throughout the book. And while both approaches are comparable in terms of performance when we have a few things, notice how that changes as the number of things increases. This book includes twelve familiar scenes, such as a living room, a tailor shop, and a department store. In each scene, there are a number of potential tasks to be done. After each illustration, a paragraph describes the scene, and a few pages of commentary and discussion relate the scene to concrete concepts from computer science and highlight at least two possible ways of undertaking the fundamental task at hand. One that’s slower and one that’s faster. That difference is what the book’s title aims to emphasize, albeit somewhat provocatively. The title is partly inspired by computer scientist Donald Knuth’s talk of “good” algorithms</p>
