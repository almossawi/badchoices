    <p class='no-indent'>If we are searching for an item in a collection of items, then surely, it must be the case that we face the possibility of having to look through all of those items before finding what we’re looking for? In other words, mustn’t it be the case that if we have one hundred items, we face the possibility of having to look through one hundred items, which is to say, taking <i>linear time</i>? Generally speaking, a linear function means that if it takes us a minute to find something among one hundred things, then we can expect to spend two minutes to find something in a pile of two hundred things. Ordinarily, yes. But there is a particular quality that a collection can have—namely, the quality of being sorted—that allows us to find an item in <i>logarithmic</i> time. In other words, in seven or so steps rather than 100. Recall that a logarithm is simply the inverse of an exponent. When writing computer programs, we assume the base of a logarithm to be two, and so the logarithm of 100 is <i>log</i><sub>2</sub>100, which comes to around seven. That massive improvement you see when going from linear time to logarithmic time is why the logarithm is such an important concept, particularly when we talk about rates of growth. It is a concept that we will revisit often throughout the coming chapters.</p>
