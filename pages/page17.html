    <p>It is my hope that this book impresses on you the ability to better think about decisions throughout your life and better understand what trade-offs they come with. The book doesn’t aim to teach you how to better match socks, an intuition that most people will likely already have, but rather to persuade you to turn the mirror on yourself and ask, “I didn’t realize I could think about <i>my</i> socks in that way.” Much like critical thinking, algorithmic thinking is a highly capable tool that has the potential to impact behavior for the better.</p>
    <h2>Why focus on everyday tasks?</h2>
    <p class='no-indent'>Algorithms can be complex, but they’re also critical and often already a part of our lives. We just don’t know it or think about it much. By highlighting those parts of our lives that serve as good models for various algorithms, we end up with an approach that has several benefits.</p>

    <p class='footnote'><sup>*</sup> There’s a funny passage in that book about one Oliver Heaviside, “an acid-tongued recluse” whose approach to teaching the mathematics of engineering was a pragmatic one. “Engineers prized Heaviside’s methods for their usefulness, but mathematicians mocked them for their lack of rigour. Heaviside had no time for pedantry (‘Shall I refuse my dinner because I do not understand digestion?’).”</p>
