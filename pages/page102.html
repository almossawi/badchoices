  <p>We began by talking about how focusing on relative magnitudes and everyday tasks helps make a complex topic more relatable. In a way, they help create triggers in our minds that remind us to continuously think about choices. The next time you see a pile of things to be sorted, perhaps you’ll think, “Ah, good and bad, fast and slow, quadratic and linearithmic.” Or the other way around. Your son, daughter, niece, or nephew might ask you what binary search is, and you’ll think, “Ah, freedom, William Wallace, Eppy Toam, shirts on a rack.” Those kinds of associations are easy and fun to recall. Recognizing good and bad choices is aided to a great extent by knowing what the catalog of choices looks like for a particular task.</p>
  <p>Nowadays, algorithm is a word that’s on a lot of people’s lips, just like big data was a few years ago; just like deep learning will be in the years to come. What I hope you’ll take away from this book is that the concept is not a fad. Rather, it is deeply rooted in history, as we saw in the discussion of Babylonian tablets early on. And because it is such a timeless concept, it is worth talking about, fleshing out, and most important of all, showing how the algorithm can be used as a tool for smarter&nbsp;thinking.</p>
