  <p>Keep this vignette in mind. We’ll come back to it in a second. First, let us describe the three methods that Ioannis might opt for to get back to the front of the store.</p>

  <p class='no-indent comparison-box'>
    <span class='concept-title'>Objective:</span> Get to the front of the store.<br />
    <span class='concept-title'>Method 1:</span> Walk through the passages, making random turns until he finds his way out.<br />
    <span class='concept-title'>Method 2:</span> Hold his right hand to the wall and follow the wall, only moving to the right the whole time.<br />
    <span class='concept-title'>Method 3:</span> Take one of the thread rolls off the wall and unwind it as he moves through the passage. If he comes to a dead end or if he stumbles across an unwound bit of thread, he turns around, walks to the last turn that he took, and takes a different path.<br />
