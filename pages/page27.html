    <p>Now, when we pick out a sock from the pile, we could probably tell fairly quickly if we’ve come across its matching pair. Most people’s short-term memory is quite good at remembering half a dozen or so groups of things, which is what we have here. And so, coming across a sock in the pile that we’ve already placed to one side ought to elicit a near-immediate “Ah, I’ve seen that one before!” If you’ve ever played a card-matching game like <i>Memory</i>, the powers and limitations of that faculty ought to be familiar to you.</p>
    <p>If we did have a bigger disparity in sock types and colors, however, our line of unmatched socks might grow quite a bit, forcing us to scan through the whole line every time we pick something new out of the pile. Scanning through a line of things, an <i>array</i>, can be time-consuming when the number of things is quite large, reason being that the thing you’re looking for might be at the very end of that line. We would thus have to pass through the entirety of the array first.</p>
    <p>In 1953, and while working at IBM, the mathematician Hans Peter Luhn drafted an idea that gave way to an alternative structure to help alleviate the potential slowness that is inherent in array lookups. It’s sometimes called an <i>associative array</i>, a <i>dictionary</i>, or a <i>hash table</i> (more salt in the wound for poor Morwenna). A hash</p>
