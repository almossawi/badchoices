  <p class='no-indent'>letters in our alphabet&mdash;as well as numbers and other characters&mdash;to a set of numerical values. Those values are then stored using a representation that the computer can understand called <i>binary</i>. Each character is represented using a binary code that may consist of seven bits. So for instance, the letter “a” is mapped to the value 97, which looks like this in binary:</p>
  <p class='text-center binary-block'>1100001</p>
  <p>The letter “b” is mapped to the value 98, which looks like this in binary:</p>
  <p class='text-center binary-block'>1100010</p>
  <p>If we wanted to therefore represent the word “hans” in binary, it would look like this, with each letter taking up seven bits for a total of 28 bits:</p>
  <p class='text-center binary-block'>1101000 1100001 1101110 1110011</p>
  <p>The nice thing about characters having binary codes with the same length (seven bits in this case) is that it makes decoding a binary string easy. All we have to do is read off every seven bits and then use a table of mappings to decode it to English.</p>
