  <p>A quick aside. One of the most interesting facts about Charles Darwin is that he spent close to two decades looking into all the possible counterarguments to his theory of evolution before he published <i>On the Origin of Species</i>. I’ve always imagined walking through a theory of that scale to be like walking through a maze, where forks along a path correspond to propositions,* where dead ends are realizations that an argument is invalid, and where exits are realizations that an argument’s conclusion seems to logically follow from its premises. It turns out that this cognitive approach of venturing to the ends of arguments and counterarguments is equally applicable when trying to escape an actual maze. And that’s precisely what we see with Method 3 and in the story about Ariadne’s thread.</p>
  <p>With this method, what Ioannis does is he makes use of <i>backtracking</i>, which is what the thread allows him to do—to backtrack whenever he hits a dead end and try a different path.<sup>&dagger;</sup> The ability to go back to intersections and try more promising routes guarantees that Ioannis will eventually find his way out. This strategy for escaping a maze is known as <i>Trémaux’s algorithm</i>, an attribution that comes from</p>

  <p class='footnote'>
    <sup>*</sup> An argument is made up of a set of statements known as propositions, each of which is either true or false.<br />
    <sup>&dagger;</sup> He could have achieved the same thing by marking intersections with a piece of chalk or by dropping bits of&nbsp;cloth.
