  <p class='no-indent'>The brain, as they say in neuroscience, has the ability to detect salience. When you’re in a quiet room and hear a noise of any kind, your brain will pick it up. If you’re in a noisy room and hear a sound that is unlike those noises, your brain will pick it up too. In a sense, information that occurs more often is considered less meaningful, which is why the brain knows to filter such input.</p>
  <p>The way in which some of us write text messages, by omitting frequently occurring letters like vowels, comes partly from an idea in information theory, where it is said that “only infrmatn esentil to understandn mst b tranmitd.” Because of various properties of the English language, the previous sentence can be fully understood despite the omitted letters, which are predictable and therefore redundant and may therefore be left out. It is for that reason that when we’re faced with the dilemma of shortening a piece of text while ensuring that it remains understandable, as Dwayne is, adopting such an approach isn’t all that bad of an idea. In fact, we used to do it all the time before the advent of predictive text.<sup>*</sup> In return for saving space, this approach does result in lost data, albeit nonessential data. Note that all the topics we have talked about so far have involved faster and slower ways</p>
