    <p class='no-indent'>As you might have guessed, Method 2 leverages two pieces of knowledge. One, that the shirts are most likely sorted on the rack by size. And two, that because Eppy’s size is a common size, which is to say, an average size, then it would likely be near the middle of the rack. Using that intuition not only to start from the middle, but to subsequently move left or right in jumps, thus halving the collection each time, is a signature of a <i>logarithmic-time</i> algorithm.<sup>*</sup> It is the same intuition we might use to look for a word in a dictionary or a name in a telephone directory or a topic in a book’s index. The same intuition we would use if we fall asleep reading a tedious novel and want to pick up where we left off the next day. More generally, we might characterize this approach as being one of discarding information. For us, the most relevant thing about logarithms is that they grow slowly, as you saw in the previous graph. We like ways of solving problems that grow slowly, because it means our method is not as sensitive to the number of things that we’re working with. In this scenario, Eppy would likely find her shirt among a rack of one hundred shirts in</p>

    <p class='footnote'><sup>*</sup> Similarly, the process of repeatedly doubling a number from 1 to <i>n</i> is also logarithmic in that we can make no more than <i>log<sub>n</sub></i> jumps before we get to <i>n</i>. For instance, how many years would it take to make a million dollars if we started with $1 and doubled it every year? We could do it by hand, or we could say <i>log</i><sub>2</sub>1,000,000 = 19.93&nbsp;years.</p>
