Bad Choices is a book all about faster and slower ways of tackling everyday problems that aims to show how thinking in such terms can lead to better decisions. In doing so, the book's cast of characters—mostly humans this time, but some critters and plants as well—introduce you to the topic of algorithmic thinking through twelve vignettes and sixty-five illustrations.
