> “Matching up your socks? Heading to the supermarket? Searching for that perfect item in a sale? Most tasks could be improved if we applied what we know about algorithms to our daily lives. Ali Almossawi will show you how.”
—__New Scientist__

> “One of the more clever ways of introducing computational thinking to the general public.”
—__Vint Cerf__, Turing Award winner, Chief Internet Evangelist at Google, a 'Father of the Internet'

> “Perfect for anyone wanting to understand the basics of Computer Science.”
—__Cesar Hidalgo__, director of the Collective Learning group at the MIT Media Lab, author of _Why Information Grows_

> “Read it with the kids and spent more than an hour arguing about different sock-sorting algorithms. Was great fun!”
—__Daniel Whiteson__, particle physicist, researcher at CERN, co-author of _We Have No Idea_

> “What I appreciated most was how the book became a survey of things I take for granted every day, shining a light on these algorithms and showing me different ways to think about and consider them.”
